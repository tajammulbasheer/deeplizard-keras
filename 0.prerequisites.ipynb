    "    - Otherwise, you will need a machine with a GPU, and you will need to install cuDNN (NVIDIA's Deep Neural Network library).\n",

    "    - Keras uses TF by default, so if using Theano or CNTK, you will need to change Keras configuration afterwards. \n",

    "4.\tInstall Keras.\n",
    "5.\tInstall a Python IDE. \n",
    "    - I prefer working with Jupyter Notebook, a scientific notebook for Python.\n",
    "    - I’ll be using this for working with Keras in subsequent videos.\n",
    "6.\tInstall HDF5 and h5py to have the ability to save Keras models to disk.\n"
