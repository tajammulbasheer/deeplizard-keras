# Keras with Tensorflow by DeepLizard
## Project Description
Keras with Tensorflow is  a course offered by Deep Lizard on YouTube with freeCodeCamp
These are notebooks I wrote following this course.<br>
Note:
Anything good and helpful in these notbooks should be credited to [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [DeepLizard](https://deeplizard.com/).
Anything foolish or incorrect assume it as my error.<br>
This basic course only uses the upper level features of Tensorflow api with help of Keras
